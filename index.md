# 1. Ethiopian Calendar
Ethiopian Calendar is a free application to manage schedules, create calendar events, set reminders, convert dates, and much more. The app supports displaying dates in Ethiopian chronology, Gregorian chronology, and Ethiopian chronology with Geez dates with an option to display one or two calendars at a time.

With the Ethiopian calendar app, you can create, edit and delete events locally without requiring an Internet connection or sync with your Google calendar so that you never miss an event even if you change your mobile device. Whether you create events in Ethiopian or Gregorian dates, the app will take care of syncing your events with Google and local calendars.

The app supports adding multiple reminders to an event in minutes, hours, days, or weeks so that you never forget about a meeting!. Additionally, it enables tracking national holidays for the current or different years.

Currently, only English and Amharic languages are supported but more languages will be added in the future.
